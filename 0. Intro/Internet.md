Now, each computer on a network is connected to a router (a special tiny computer). It is like a railway station, to make sure that a message sent from A arrives at the right destination B.

# 2. So, how to find the destination computer?

Any computer linked to a network has a unique address - "IP address" (Internet Protocol). For example: 192.0.2.172. To make it easier for our humans, we invented the Domain Name System(DNS). For example: google.com == 142.250.190.78.

# 3. Difference between a webpage, website, web server, and search engine?

- **web page**  
  A document which can be displayed in a web browser.

- **website**  
  A website is a collection of linked web pages that share a unique domain name.

- **web server**  
   A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.

- **search engine**  
  A web service that helps you find other web pages.
