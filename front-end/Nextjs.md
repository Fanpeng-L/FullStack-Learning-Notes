# Next.js

## 1. Rendering
**Client-Side Rendering:**  
In a standard React application, the browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. This is called client-side rendering because the initial rendering work happens on the user's device.  
**Pre-Rendering:**  
Next.js pre-renders every page by default. The HTML is generated in advance, on a server, instead of having it all done by JavaScript on the user's device.
