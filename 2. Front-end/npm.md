Around 2010, several JavaScript package managers emerged to help ðŸ¦¾automateðŸ¦¾ the process of downloading and upgrading libraries from a central repository. npm has been most popular since around 2015. (around late 2016, yarn picked up a lot of attention)

# ðŸ’œ Basics

## 1. install

`npm i <package name>` install locally

`npm i -g <package name>` install globally

## 2. `package.json`

`$ npm init`

It will ask a bunch of questions to set up, and then write a package.json file.

`$ npm install` install all the dependencies for a project
